# mve

Code for various internet of things projects.  Will eventually contain 
generally useful python modules for IOT related projects, as well as
the main source code for various hardward devices.

The goal is to provide usable code as well as ideas for other projects.

# Directories

## lib
Root for all the python files.  Every directory under lib will be
part of a python namespace.

projects, for example, the code is in mve.mobicam and the directions
are in projects/mobicam.
